    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>Up close and personal</h4>
    <p>My name is Salik Hassan and I am in my 3rd year of Computer Science Program at York University. My fascination is currently towards Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence because that is going to lead the world in the near future. I am
      originally from Pakistan which explains my obsession with cricket. I play cricket at a professional level in Canada and aim to break into the national team soon. Archery has also caught my interest and I am taking it up on a weekly basis. My
      interests and hobbies have shaped me into what I am today. I believe playing cricket is the closest I can come to becoming a warrior. This amazing sport has taught me perseverance, staying focused in high pressure situations, and staring right
      into the face of adversity when the odds are against me.

      <br><br />Technology has always fascinated me since a very young age but due to financial limitations and lack of modern technology in Pakistan at the time, I could not get to learn much about it. When we moved to Canada in 2014, I got access
      to
      the latest
      technology and I could engross myself in learning about various gadgets till my heart was content. I was gravitated towards back end development due to the sheer possibilities it entailed. I arranged a computer science club in my final year of
      high school where I, along with my peers,helped junior students get started on their coding journeys with Java. I finally followed up my enthusiasm by getting enrolled in the Computer Science Program at York University. I believe my
      problem-solving skills and perseverance will aid me to become successful in this program.

    <h2>My Goals for 2022</h2>
    <h4>Where I want to be</h4>
  </center>

  <p><strong>Communication Skills</strong></p>
  <p>Enroll in and complete a public speaking course to enhance my oral presentation skills.

    This goal will help me in my academic as well as professional life. I will be able to communicate my ideas better to an audience and avoid the problem of being nervous during presentations. Nervousness and anxiety causes me to panic during
    presentations and achieving this goal will improve my confidence.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p><strong>Collaboration and Leadership Skills</strong></p>
  <p>I will gain 50 organic LinkedIn connections through connecting with industry leaders and people that have achieved what I want to achieve

    This goal is vital for networking in my professional field because I can then leverage my connections to get important opportunities in my career. I will also be able to listen to their stories and learn how they got where they are today.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p><strong>Initiative taking and entrepreneurial skills</strong></p>
  <p>Develop technical solutions to tend to the requirements of people and fill market gaps by taking part in Hackathons in Lassonde and other institutions

    This will give me a sense of how to develop software-as-a-service platforms and enable me to develop my own software start-up in the near future. Entrepreneurial experience will be gained and it will help me get an understanding of starting a company before actually diving into the world of entrepreneurship.
